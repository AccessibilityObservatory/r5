/**
 * Logic to create SpatialDataSource metadata from an uploaded GeoJSON file and perform validation.
 *
 * GeoJSON geometries are JSON objects with a type property (Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiPolygon,
 * or MultiLineString) and an array of coordinates. The "multi" types simply have another level of nested arrays.
 * Geometries are usually nested into objects of type "Feature", which allows attaching properties. Features can be
 * further nested into a top-level object of type FeatureCollection. We only support GeoJSON whose top level object is
 * a FeatureCollection (not a single Feature or a single Geometry), and where every geometry is of the same type.
 *
 * For consistency with other vector data sources and our internal geometry representation, we are using the
 * (unsupported) GeoTools module gt-geojsondatasource for loading GeoJSON into a FeatureCollection of OpenGIS Features.
 *
 * This is somewhat problematic because GeoJSON does not adhere to some common GIS principles. For example, in a
 * GeoJSON feature collection, every single object can have a different geometry type and different properties, or
 * even properties with the same name but different data types. For simplicity we only support GeoJSON inputs that
 * have a consistent schema across all features - the same geometry type and attribute types on every feature. We
 * still need to verify these constraints ourselves, as GeoTools does not enforce them.
 *
 * It is notable that GeoTools will not work correctly with GeoJSON input that does not respect these constraints, but
 * it does not detect or report those problems - it just fails silently. For example, GeoTools will report the same
 * property schema for every feature in a FeatureCollection. If a certain property is reported as having an integer
 * numeric type, but a certain feature has text in the attribute of that same name, the reported value will be an
 * Integer object with a value of zero, not a String.
 *
 * This behavior is odd, but remember that the gt-geojsondatastore module is unsupported (though apparently on the path
 * to being supported) and was only recently included in Geotools releases. We may want to make code contributions to
 * Geotools to improve JSON validation and error reporting.
 *
 * Section 4 of the GeoJSON RFC at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-4 defines the only acceptable
 * coordinate reference system as WGS84. You may notice older versions of the GeoTools GeoJSON handler have CRS parsing
 * capabilities. This is just support for an obsolete feature and should not be invoked. We instead range check all
 * incoming coordinates (via a total bounding box check) to ensure they look reasonable in WGS84.
 *
 * Note that QGIS will happily and silently export GeoJSON with a crs field, which gt-geojsondatastore will happily
 * read and report that it's in WGS84 without ever looking at the crs field. This is another case where Geotools would
 * seriously benefit from added validation and error reporting, and where we need to add stopgap validation of our own.
 *
 * In GeoTools, FeatureSource is a read-only mechanism but it can apparently only return FeatureCollections which load
 * everything into memory. FeatureReader provides iterator-style access, but seems quite low-level and not intended
 * for regular use. Because we limit the size of file uploads we can be fairly sure it will be harmless for the backend
 * to load any data fully into memory. Feature streaming capabilities and/or streaming JSON decoding can be added later
 * if the need arises. The use of FeatureReader and FeatureSource are explained well at:
 * https://docs.geotools.org/stable/userguide/tutorial/datastore/read.html
