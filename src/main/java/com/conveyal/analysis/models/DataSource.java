/**
 * This represents a file which was uploaded by the user and validated by the backend. Instances are persisted to Mongo.
 * DataSources can be processed into derived products like aggregation areas, destination grids, and transport networks.
 * Subtypes exist to allow additional fields on certain kinds of data sources. The attribute "type" of instances
 * serialized into Mongo is a "discriminator" which determines the corresponding Java class on deserialization.
 *
 * Given the existence of descriminators in the Mongo driver, for now we're trying full Java typing with inheritance.
 * It is debatable whether we get any advantages from this DataSource class hierarchy as opposed to a single class with
 * some fields left null in certain cases (e.g. feature schema is null on OSM DataSources). Juggling different classes
 * may not be worth the trouble unless we get some utility out of polymorphic methods. For example, Mongo collections
 * will return the shared supertype, leaving any specialized fields inaccessible except via overridden methods.
 * Usefulness will depend on how different the different subtypes are, and we haven't really seen that yet.
 * The main action we take on DataSources is to process them into derived data. That can't easily use polymorphism.
