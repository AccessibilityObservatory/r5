/**
 * This is an exact copy of RaptorWorker that's being modified to work with (new) TransitNetworks
 * instead of (old) Graphs. We can afford the maintainability nightmare of duplicating so much code because this is
 * intended to completely replace the old class soon.
 *
 * A RaptorWorker carries out RAPTOR searches on a pre-filtered, compacted representation of all the trips running
 * during a given time window. It originated as a rewrite of our RAPTOR code that would use "thin workers", allowing
 * computation by a generic function-execution service like AWS Lambda. The gains in efficiency were significant enough
 * that RaptorWorkers are now used in the context of a full-size OTP server executing spatial analysis tasks.
 *
 * We can imagine that someday all OTP searches, including simple point-to-point searches, may be carried out on such
 * compacted tables, including both the transit and street searches (via a compacted street network in a column store
 * or struct-like byte array using something like the FastSerialization library).
 *
 * This implements the RAPTOR algorithm; see http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/156567/raptor_alenex.pdf
