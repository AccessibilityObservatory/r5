/**
 * Experimental helper functions for travel time propagation using the new Vector API in JDK 19.
 * The Vector API is an 'incubating' feature to ensure the compiler emits SIMD instructions for repetitive
 * pipelined operations on large contiguous arrays.
 *
 * You don't need to do anything to enable "incubating" JDK features. They are just packages located under
 * jdk.incubator that you have to import. This is in contrast to preview features (~95% complete),
 * which must be enabled with the â€“enable-preview compiler flag, and experimental features (~25% complete)
 * which may be unstable and must each be enabled with their own individual compiler flag.
 *
 * From https://openjdk.org/jeps/338
 * A scalar loop is required at the end, duplicating code...
 * [this] issue will not be fully addressed by this JEP and will be the subject of future work.
 * As shown in the first example, you can use masks to implement vector computation without tail processing.
 * We anticipate that such masked loops will work well for a range of architectures, including x64 and ARM,
 * but will require additional runtime compiler support to generate maximally efficient code.
 * Such work on masked loops, though important, is beyond the scope of this JEP.
