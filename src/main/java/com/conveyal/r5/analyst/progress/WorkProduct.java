 * A unique identifier for the final product of a single TaskAction. Currently this serves as both an internal data
 * structure and an API model class, which should be harmless as it's an immutable data class. The id is unique within
 * the type, so the regionId is redundant information, but facilitates prefectches on the UI. If isGroup is true, the
 * id is not that of an individual record, but the dataGroupId of several records created in a single operation.
