/**
 * An attempt to generalize reading from a raster DataSource.
 * The usual case is that we sample along edges and store those sample points, or sample individual points.
 * We have a class that performs the sampling but it was originally designed for elevation data.
 * The trick is that we may load from different data types (single-bit integers through double precision floating point).
 * We also want to perform the sampling in a multi-threaded way, so the sampler instance needs to expose methods that
 * are threadsafe when called in a parallel stream or thread pool. But all those millions of edge-sampling operations
 * will use the same configuration so we want to set all that here rather than on separate objects generated at each
 * edge-sampling. But certain state needs to be retained on each edge, which implies a class instance per edge.

 * TODO replace all references to elevation with more general terms
