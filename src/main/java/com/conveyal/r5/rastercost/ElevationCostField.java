/**
 * This represents the changes in elevation along every edge in the network, as well as the derived additional costs
 * for traversing those elevation changes.
 *
 * Inspecting the resulting edge elevation profiles reveals that a large number of them are the same elevation over the
 * entire length of the edge, or very smooth linear changes. These can be simplified and compressed in several ways:
 * 1. Where both end vertices and every sample point are at the same elevation, the sample points can simply be removed.
 * 2. Where the sample points fall roughly on a straight line between the two end vertices the sample points are not
 * needed. Item 1 is a special case of item 2.
 * 3. ...
 * 4. If after all these simplifications less than half of the edges have an explicit elevation profile, we may want to
 * store them in a map instead of an array for better cache efficiency.
 *
 * The underlying per-edge storage mechanism is not shared with the tree shade costs because they have different
 * characteristics. The tree shade is boolean and can be stored as only the distances along the edge where we enter or
 * exit shade.
 *
 * However, storing alternating (distance, elevation change) in a packed array of shorts or bytes would be much easier
 * to deal with when splitting edges.
 *
 * In this case tree shade might be able to share the storage model. The value change elements would all be +/- 1 which
 * would waste some space, but the code reuse might be worth it. And of course this would also allow greyscale shade
 * instead of binary shade inputs.
